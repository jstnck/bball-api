## udemy-flask-apis app --> docker-compose

this repo starts with the flask api from a udemy course
https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/
by Jose Salvatierra

i was having trouble deploying it to aws in section 7 of the course, 
so instead im trying to use docker to containerize the app and webserver
    1. flask app (api) + uwsgi
    2. postgres
    3. nginx
